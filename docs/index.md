| MANUAL                        | ASSISTED                      |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1. You'll get one or more of the following folders: `Menu / ScriptResources / Tool / Utility`.           | 1. From Moho's main menus, go to "Scripts -> Install Script..." and a window with some info will appear.           | 
| 2. Drag & Drop (or Copy & Paste) them all into the Scripts folder of your [Custom Content Folder][3-1a]. | 2. Press *Select A Script Folder* button, browse to the just uzipped folder (e.g. ls_shapes_window) and select it. |
| 3. Restart MohoÂ® or press `Alt + Shift + Ctrl + L` to *Reload Tools And Brushes* and the script should appear in *Tools* palette and/or under *Scripts* menu.   | 3. That done, the script should appear in *Tools* palette and/or under *Scripts* menu. See chapter [23.17 Install Script...][3-2a] of MohoÂ® user's manual for further details.     |

> âš  **WARNING:** Please, make sure you have uninstalled every Lost Script on your system before removing any of these shared resources or they may start throwing errors or stop working. For uninstalling a script, just remove any file and folder matching its name and restart MohoÂ® or Reload Tools And Brushes if necessary.

<br>

## Usage

1. **Opening**: Open *Shapes Window* from Moho's *Tools* palette or via its entry in the *Scripts* menu.
2. **Operating**: Now you can have it permanently open to perform various shape operations.
3. **Customizing**: Unfold Window's main menu: ðŸ”½ (at top left of the window) to access different settings & actions.
4. **Tooltips**: Hold the cursor over the different elements to get a hint of their functionality...
